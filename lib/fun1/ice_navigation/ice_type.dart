                      'Sea ice is very different to fresh water ice. It forms more slowly because salt water sinks away from the cold surface before it cools enough to freeze. The averages salinity of the ocean can vary in density from 1020-1030, but in polar regions it may be of a density less than 1016. The freezing point of seawater varies according to its salinity. When ocean salinity is 35 psu (35,000p pm), the sea water freezes at minus 1.8째C(28.8째F). Fresh water freezes at 0째C (32째F). Because oceans are so deep, it takes longer to reach freezing point, so the top 100 to 150 metres (300 to 450 feet) of water must be cooled to the freezing temperature for ice to form.\n'
                          'When sea ice is first formed, it contains pockets of brine between the ice crystals. Normal temperature fluctuations in the ice cause the pockets of brine to change in salt concentration. As the ice becomes colder, water freezes to the sides of the pockets, making the brine more concentrated, while warmer temperatures cause the inner walls of the pockets to melt, diluting the brine. Because of this, the strength of sea ice is more dramatically affected by temperature than fresh water ice.\n'
                      'It is well known that water expands as it freezes. However, once it is ice, it shrinks as it becomes colder. Changes in air temperature can cause ice to bend and thermal cracks to form. As the season progresses, any salts gradually drain from the ice until, after approximately one year, the ice is formed of almost completely fresh water. There are a number of identifiable ice types, both sea and that can be encountered.\n\n',
